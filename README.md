# GoData extension offering DRM service

_Anonymization of GoData cases which helps provide the anonymization of patiens without loosing the ability of GoData contact tracing. Thus providing privacy and security for patient sensitive data while keeping unsensitive information available for the hospitals and epidemiologist_

## Taking off üöÄ

_These instructions will allow you to get a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes._

Go to **Deployment** to deploy the project.


### Pre-requisites üìã

_First and foremost ._
```
Running GoData Server with a User is required
```
_Second a mongodb BDD is required._
```
MongoDB connection URI must be provided in 
Go.Data_Enc_Serv\src\database.ts
```
### Installation üîß

_To be able to deploy the DRM Server, just use_

_npm install_

```
cd Go.Data_Enc_Serv\
npm install
```

_and repeat the process, to deploy chrome anonymization extension_

```
cd Go.Data_Enc_Serv\
npm install
```
_Also need to configure the GoData URL which lets know the DRM server where the GoData server is located, which could be a real location, or can be the locally hosted GoData._

```
Make a copy of the file Go.Data_Enc_Serv\src\lib\config_example.ts and rename it to config.ts 
```
_Once we have a config.ts file, we need to fill the empty values_
```
 URL: GoData API location
 USER: Email used to enter godata server
 PASSWORD: Password in clear, used to access GoData
 OUTBREAK_ID: Outbreak Id in GoData
 sensitiveData: Fields we want to protect, such as firstName
                Must match with GoData!
```
